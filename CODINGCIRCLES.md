# Coding Circles

## Overview

We will be working exclusively in this monorepo. Any new ideas or todos will be raised as issues. Anyone can suggest new ideas by creating a new issue. Tasks will be assigned through issues as well, along with pull requests. 

## Week 1

Goals:

- Everyone create an issue for an idea for something they thing is missing (yes, there is a lot, and yes, technically everything is covered)
- Everyone create a PR for a small change, request review, and merge.
- Add everyone as a collaborator with read-only
- Get through everyone's names

If time, have people start working on specific parts, by adding the relevant issues and assigning it.


## Week 2

Start with a standup

Teach Rebasing
